Pong Test Minigame

This project was made in Godot as a part of me learning how to mess around with the engine. It was a fun ride of almost two weeks, way too long as I initially expected. Hope you enjoy it.
Controls:

    SPACE BAR: SELECT (used in title screen to select game mode)
    ENTER: START (used in title screen to start a game mode)
    ESC: RESET (Can be used to reset the game and go back to the title screen)
    W and S: Up and down respectively for Player 1
    Up and down arrow keys: Up and down respectively for Player 2 (Only on P1 vs P2 mode)
